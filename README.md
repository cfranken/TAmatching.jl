This package enables a beta version for TA matching based on available algorithms in other areas (matchmaking, e.g. the National Resident Matching Program).

We first have to create a google form, in which all students have to select their choices of courses to TA, for which they can can also rank priority. At least 3 choices have to be made per student, with up to 5 (optional).
